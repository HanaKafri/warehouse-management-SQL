# warehouse-SQL
a java system that helps a warehouse manages their data with a MYSQL database
I made a system using Java, with a full MYSQL database to help a warehouse manage their data about companies, stores and people they work with, and manage their wares.
To run this system, you need to fix the data of the sql file at the beginning of the code, and open it.
When running the system, the main screen will show up, that you can move to other screens from it.
Each screen resembles a table in the database, and has 4 functions that is used to update the database (insert, edit, delete, and select).
